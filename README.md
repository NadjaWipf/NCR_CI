# NCR_CI

R, python, and bash code for the analyses, figures and tables in the research article "Multi-insecticide resistant malaria vectors in the field remain susceptible to malathion, despite the presence of Ace1 point mutations" on negative cross-resistance (NCR) in CÃ´te d'Ivoire (CI).

### note on the bash scripts

The presented bash scripts were originally configured to run on an HPC architecture managed with SLURM. 
As we have modified the code to avoid exposing our infrastructure, minor modifications may be needed to get the scripts working (in particular, with respect to the module loading and the handling of array jobs).
